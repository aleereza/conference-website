<h3>Instructions for Authors</h3>
<p>Please read the following instructions carefully. By submitting a manuscript to MMSP, the authors guarantee that the material is original and that it has not been published, and is not currently submitted for consideration, elsewhere.</p><p>Two types of papers will be considered for submission: regular and special session papers (full paper) and demo papers. <strong>Only accepted regular and special session (full) papers will be published on IEEE Xplore. </strong>All accepted papers will be included in the digital conference proceedings.
</p>
<p><strong>1. Regular and Special Session papers (Full Paper):</strong> 4-6 page paper, including all text, figures and references, ready for archival publication in IEEE Xplore if accepted.</p><p><strong>2. Demo Paper:</strong> 1 page paper with Title, Author/s, Abstract, and Prototype Description.</p><p>All paper types <strong>MUST</strong> be formatted according to Microsoft Word or Latex templates given below.</p><p>All papers <strong>MUST</strong> be submitted by their respective <Link className={styles.link} to="/dates">deadline dates</Link>. There will be no exceptions.</p>
<p>Accepted papers <strong>MUST</strong> be presented at the conference by one of the authors, or, if none of the authors are able to attend, by a qualified proxy, approved at least two weeks in advance of the conference dates by the TPC co-chairs. In case a paper is not presented at the workshop, it shall be deemed a “no-show.” For the poster session, in case there is no speaker in front of a poster, this implies a “no-show” (one of the authors should be present at the beginning and for most of entire poster session, for the introduction of the paper and answering questions). <strong>No-show papers will not appear on IEEE Xplore following the IEEE No-Show Policy. </strong>Exceptions to this policy will be made by the MMSP 2018 Technical Program Chairs only if there is evidence that the no-show occurred because of unanticipated events beyond the control of the authors, and that every option available to the authors to present the paper was exhausted.
</p>
<p>A <strong>full</strong> (non-student) registration <strong>MUST</strong> be made by one of the regular and special session paper authors by the author registration deadline (camera-ready paper submission deadline). Failure to register before the deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of your paper from the conference proceedings and program.
</p>
<p>A <strong>full</strong> (non-student) registration <strong>MUST</strong> be made by one of the demo paper authors by June 30. Failure to register before this deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of your demo paper from the conference proceedings and program.
</p>
<p>Paper submission is handled via the CMT system. Please submit your paper at <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMSP2018" rel="noopener noreferrer">cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MMSP2018</a>
